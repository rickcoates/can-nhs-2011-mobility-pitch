## Why this data product, why now?

* There has been much discussion, especially within Atlantic Canada, with respect 
to the "brain drain" of young people "moving west" in search of high-paying jobs
in the oil and gas sector.

* Statistics Canada conducted a National Household Survey (NHS) in 2011 that
explicitly addressed the question of migration and mobility in Canada.

* A new data set, derived from the StatsCan NHS Data Tables (catalogue numbers 
[99-013-X2011026](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Ap-eng.cfm?LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=0&GK=0&GRP=0&PID=105554&PRID=0&PTYPE=105277&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=2013&THEME=97&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=)
and

was created specifically for this data product to investigate 
mobility and migration of young people (ages 15-34).

* This new data set, when combined with an accompanying interactive web application, 
lets you _easily_ explore the migration patterns of young people within Canada.

* Find answers to current questions concerning the mobility of young people in 
Canada _for yourself_ that are _backed up by solid data_.

## Advantages

There are several key advantages this data product has over the StatsCan NHS migration
and mobility data products:
        
    
1. The NHS mobility 5 years ago (
[99-013-X2011026](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Ap-eng.cfm?LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=0&GK=0&GRP=0&PID=105554&PRID=0&PTYPE=105277&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=2013&THEME=97&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=))
and mobility 1 year ago (
[99-013-X2011028](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Ap-eng.cfm?LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=0&GK=0&GRP=0&PID=105579&PRID=0&PTYPE=105277&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=2013&THEME=97&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=))  
NHS data products are combined into a __single data product__.
2. This data product is __focused__ on the mobility of young people and, as such, 
is organized and presented in a way that serves this specific research topic more 
readily than the more general purpose NHS data products.
3. Mobility data is presented in a __graphical chart__ form, rather than the tabular 
form provided by the NHS data products. 
<br>
The result is new data product is __very easy to use__ to simplify the research efforts of even the most 
casual user.

## Features

* Multiple migration variables are available, including: 
```{r show-data, echo=FALSE, size="small"}
data <- read.csv("CDN-NHS-2011-Migration.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
data$Age.Group <- factor(data$Age.Group)
data$Mobility.Years <- factor(data$Mobility.Years)
variable.choices <- colnames(data)[-c(1:3)]
names(variable.choices) <- sub("-"," ", gsub("\\.","-",variable.choices))
noquote(names(variable.choices))
```
* Data for areas ranging from the entire country, to each province _and_ major cities/towns.
* Side-by-side comparision of 5 year and 1 year mobility

```{r show-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
library(ggplot2)
anArea <- "New Brunswick"
selected.area <- data[data$Area == anArea,]
aVariable <- "Interprovincial.out.migrants"
p <- ggplot(selected.area, aes_string(x="Age.Group", y=aVariable, fill="Mobility.Years")) + 
    geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge") +
    xlab("Age Group") +
    ylab("Number of migrants") +
    ggtitle(paste(sub("-"," ", gsub("\\.","-",aVariable)), "for", anArea))
print(p)  
```
</center>
* Extensive documentation explaining each of the migration variables.
